    <h1>Welcome to Coffee Bin!</h1>
    <p>Are you a coffee enthusiast who loves exploring new flavors and aromas in your daily brew? If so, you've come to
        the right place! At Coffee Bin, we take pride in offering you a delightful journey into the world of acidity in
        coffee.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Acidic Coffee</h2>
    <p>Acidic coffee, often referred to as "coffee with acidity," has been a long-standing trend in many foreign
        countries. Over time, this trend found its way into South Korea, and it has taken the coffee scene by storm. You
        might be wondering, why has acidic coffee become so popular? Let's take a closer look at the factors behind this
        phenomenon.</p>

    <h2>Defining Coffee Quality through Acidity</h2>
    <p>One of the key reasons behind the popularity of acidic coffee lies in its impact on coffee quality. Coffee with
        good acidity showcases a diverse range of flavors, offering a cleaner and more nuanced taste experience. As
        coffee quality improves, the acidity level becomes a crucial factor in defining the overall taste profile of the
        coffee.</p>

    <h2>The Connection with Coffee Bean Quality</h2>
    <p>The rise of acidity in coffee is intricately linked to the improvement in coffee bean quality. Coffee farms have
        been dedicatedly working to produce beans with excellent acidity, resulting in an influx of high-quality coffee
        beans in the market. The competition among coffee farms to produce the best beans has led to a natural
        progression towards better coffee quality.</p>

    <h2>The Journey of Coffee Beans from Farm to Cup</h2>
    <p>The journey of coffee beans from farm to cup involves various steps that contribute to the enhancement of acidity
        in coffee. With the improved quality of beans, coffee farms have gained recognition and support, leading to
        better working conditions and welfare for the laborers. This transformation has not only improved the quality of
        coffee but also the livelihood of those involved in the coffee farming industry.</p>

    <h2>Preserving the Intrinsic Taste through Light Roasting</h2>
    <p>We, at Coffee Bin, believe in preserving the intrinsic taste and aroma of coffee beans. Light roasting is our
        chosen method to achieve this goal. Just like roasting pork belly to enjoy its true taste, we carefully roast
        coffee beans to bring out the best flavors without compromising on taste.</p>

    <h2>The Role of Coffee Equipment and Baristas</h2>
    <p>However, making light roast coffee that perfectly preserves the flavors is not without its challenges. Coffee
        equipment, such as the espresso machine, has seen significant developments to extract the full flavor from
        robust light roasts. Skilled baristas play a crucial role in understanding and utilizing the features of these
        machines to bring out the best in each cup of coffee.</p>

    <h2>Your Journey with Coffee Bin</h2>

        provide you with a taste and aroma that suits your preferences, whether you seek inspiration, focus, or a moment
